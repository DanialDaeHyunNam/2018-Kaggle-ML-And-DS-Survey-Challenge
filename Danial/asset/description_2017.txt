#### 2017 files description
- conversionRates : 
    - Currency conversion rates (to USD) as accessed from the R package "quantmod" on September 14, 2017.
- schema :
    - A CSV file with survey schema. This schema includes the questions that correspond to each column name in both the multipleChoiceResponses.csv and freeformResponses.csv.
- multipleChoiceResponses : 
    - Respondents' answers to multiple choice and ranking questions. These are non-randomized and thus a single row does correspond to all of a single user's answers.
- freeFormResponses :
    - Respondents' freeform answers to Kaggle's survey questions. These responses are randomized within a column, so that reading across a single row does not give a single user's answers.
